    "summary": "I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Hawai'i Manoa since fall 2021, working on autonomous perception and safety on South African roads using active learning with assistive annotation techniques, under the supervision of Professors Kyungim Baek and Huaijin Chen. I also completed an M.S in CS under the supervision of Peter Sadowski, working on computer vision for marine life conservation. Before moving to UH, I worked on natural language processing, and adversarial music generation with Dr Anna Bosman, and Dr Pieter Devilliers at the university of Pretoria.",
