summary: Bowride is a website that will allow users to organize carpools with other members of the UH community. Users can sign up to be a driver or rider, and drivers can search for riders that are most convenient to/from campus. This was a group effort for the ICS314 (Software engineering) final project.

The purpose of this project was to work as a team to implement a medium scale  web application using the software stack (semantic-ui, react, meteor) covered in ICS 314. Another key requirement was that such a project should be a potential solution to a problem in the UH manoa student community. The problem we tackled was that sometimes students feel unsafe or uncomfortable riding uber or lyft with drivers they see for the first time and may never see again.

Our solution was to create a web application that will allow students with cars to post an offer to drive, and a student with the same intended destination can opt to ride with the offering student. As registration is only restricted to UH email addresses, this ensures student ride with other student or faculty only, reinforcing safety and comfort. The other added benefit is that this creates an extra channel for students to forge long lasting friends within the UH community.
